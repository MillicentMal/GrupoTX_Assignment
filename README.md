This is the repository that contains the Grupo-TX Assignment. 

Assumptions made:
1. This is an address book that will keep contact information of people publicly. It will work as a form of phone book that will list a contact with the following details:
a. Name
First and last name
b. Phone number
c. EMail
d. Addresses 

People can only add or see contacts. 

Functionality that would make this better:
Add an admin that would vet any new additions 
Allow for edits, and deletes that would still go through the admin
Pagination to handle more and more additions of contacts
Search button to actually search all these contacts 
Seperation of concerns/modularization
